# filtering options you can apply to a group of users.  The value must be 1 or more.
# DansGuardian will automatically look for dansguardianfN.conf where N is the filter
# group.  To assign users to groups use the filtergroupslist option.  All users default
# to filter group 1.  You must have some sort of authentication to be able to map users
# to a group.  The more filter groups the more copies of the lists will be in RAM so
# use as few as possible.

# Lower casing options
# When a document is scanned the uppercase letters are converted to lower case

# When a document is scanned it can optionally convert %XX to chars.

# Force Quick Search rather than DFA search algorithm
# The current DFA implementation is not totally 16-bit character compatible

# enable this option.

# Reverse lookups for banned site and URLs.
# If set to on, DansGuardian will look up the forward DNS for an IP URL
# address and search for both in the banned site and URL lists.  This would
# prevent a user from simply entering the IP for a banned address.
# It will reduce searching speed somewhat so unless you have a local caching
# DNS server, leave it off and use the Blanket IP Block option in the
# bannedsitelist file instead.
reverseaddresslookups = off



# Reverse lookups for banned and exception IP lists.
# If set to on, DansGuardian will look up the forward DNS for the IP

# It will reduce searching speed somewhat so unless you have a local DNS server, 
# leave it off.

# POST protection (web upload and forms)
# does not block forms without any file upload, i.e. this is just for
# blocking or limiting uploads

# use -1 for no blocking

# Max content filter page size
# Sometimes web servers label binary files as text which can be very
# large which causes a huge drain on memory and cpu resources.
# To counter this, you can limit the size of the document to be
# filtered and get it to just pass it straight through.
# This setting also applies to content regular expression modification.

# You can have as many methods as you want and not just one.  The first one
# will be used then if no username is found, the next will be used.
# * proxyauth is for when basic proxy authentication is used (no good for
#   transparent proxying).
# * ntlm is for when the proxy supports the MS NTLM authentication
#   protocol.  (Only works with IE5.5 sp1 and later).  **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
# * ident is for when the others don't work.  It will contact the computer
#   that the connection came from and try to connect to an identd server
#   and query it for the user owner of the connection.

# Preemptive banning - this means that if you have proxy auth enabled and a user accesses
# a site banned by URL for example they will be denied straight away without a request
# for their user and pass.  This has the effect of requiring the user to visit a clean
# site first before it knows who they are and thus maybe an admin user.
# This is how DansGuardian has always worked but in some situations it is less than
# ideal.  So you can optionally disable it.  Default is on.
# As a side effect disabling this makes AD image replacement work better as the mime
# type is know.
