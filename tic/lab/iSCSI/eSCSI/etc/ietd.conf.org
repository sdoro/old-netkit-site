# Example iscsi target configuration
#
# Everything until the first target definition belongs
# to the global configuration.
# Right now this is only the user configuration used
# during discovery sessions:

User joe secret

# Targets definitions start with "Target" and the target name.
# The target name must be a globally unique name, the iSCSI
# standard defines the "iSCSI Qualified Name" as follows:
#
# iqn.yyyy-mm.<reversed domain name>[:identifier]
#
# "yyyy-mm" is the date at which the domain is valid and the identifier
# is freely selectable. For further details please check the iSCSI spec.

Target iqn.2001-04.com.example:storage.disk2.sys1.xyz
	# Users, who can access this target
	# (no users means anyone can access the target)
